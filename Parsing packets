In Rust, parsing small, structured packets like these can be done using a combination of enums, pattern matching, and helper functions for deserialization. Here’s an overview of some standard approaches that could make your code both readable and maintainable:

### 1. Define a Packet Enum for Packet Types
You can define an enum to represent the different packet types. This enum can hold variants with associated data for each packet type, and if each packet type has a different structure, enums allow for type safety and pattern matching.

For example:
```rust
enum Packet {
    TypeA { status: u8, data: Vec<u8> },
    TypeB { status: u8, data: [u8; 4] },
    TypeC { status: u8, data: u8 },
    // Add other packet types as needed
}
```

### 2. Implement a `from_bytes` Method for Parsing
You can implement a method like `from_bytes` for the `Packet` enum to parse the incoming byte slice based on the packet type. This function could match on the type byte to determine how to parse the data.

```rust
impl Packet {
    fn from_bytes(bytes: &[u8]) -> Option<Self> {
        if bytes.len() < 2 {
            return None; // Ensure there are at least two bytes for type and status
        }

        let packet_type = bytes[0];
        let status = bytes[1];

        match packet_type {
            0x01 => {
                // TypeA with variable-length data
                Some(Packet::TypeA {
                    status,
                    data: bytes[2..].to_vec(),
                })
            },
            0x02 => {
                // TypeB with exactly 4 bytes of data
                if bytes.len() >= 6 {
                    Some(Packet::TypeB {
                        status,
                        data: [bytes[2], bytes[3], bytes[4], bytes[5]],
                    })
                } else {
                    None // Insufficient data for TypeB
                }
            },
            0x03 => {
                // TypeC with a single data byte
                if bytes.len() >= 3 {
                    Some(Packet::TypeC {
                        status,
                        data: bytes[2],
                    })
                } else {
                    None // Insufficient data for TypeC
                }
            },
            _ => None, // Unknown packet type
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. Use Pattern Matching to Handle the Parsed Packet
Once you've parsed the packet, you can use pattern matching to handle each variant. Rust’s exhaustive pattern matching will help catch any missing cases if you add new packet types later.

```rust
fn handle_packet(packet: Packet) {
    match packet {
        Packet::TypeA { status, data } => {
            println!("Received TypeA packet with status {} and data {:?}", status, data);
        },
        Packet::TypeB { status, data } => {
            println!("Received TypeB packet with status {} and data {:?}", status, data);
        },
        Packet::TypeC { status, data } => {
            println!("Received TypeC packet with status {} and data {}", status, data);
        },
    }
}
```

### Benefits of This Approach
1. **Type Safety**: Each packet type has a well-defined structure, reducing parsing errors.
2. **Extensibility**: Adding new packet types is easy with enums.
3. **Exhaustiveness**: Rust will enforce exhaustive matching on enums, making sure all packet types are handled.

### Alternative: Using Structs Instead of Enums
If enums feel cumbersome, another option is to define a `Packet` struct with a `packet_type`, `status`, and `data` field. You could then use a method like `parse_data` to interpret the data based on `packet_type`. However, this sacrifices some type safety and may increase the chance of runtime errors if the structure of `data` varies greatly across types.

This enum-based parsing approach is fairly standard in Rust for packet handling and will help keep your code safe and modular.
